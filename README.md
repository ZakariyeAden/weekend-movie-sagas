-- I know what to do for Genres.I can picture what to do although im having issue with Menu Selection. Make it work in MovieList with Conditional render.Currently doing it in separate component to make it work.

--For useParams, I seen some Documentation and googling. Do I need to use React Redux Connect?I tried using Connect but the data from sagas wasn't passing through in the params.I did the method we used in Class during Assignment to route to separate page.
